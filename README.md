Foundations - Landing Page Project (Flexbox)

I wanted to put some decent effort into this project. I have some experience working with Wordpress and when I started learning about flexbox it reminded me of how convenient some features of Beaver Builder are when building containers and placing them. There were a few things I've used in Beaver Builder which weren't part of this project but things that I wanted to figure out how and if I could replicate them using flexbox. Such as setting the width of all content to 1100px whilst maintaining the background colours / images at the full width of the viewport.

Known-Bugs:
- hero text-container shrinks too much with a narrow viewport

To-Do:
- add box shadow to header
- move hero background image down a few pixels to show top of structure
- wrap content so that it drops from 4 wide to 2 then 1
